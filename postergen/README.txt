OlharesPoster project/exercise
========================================================================

This is a complete & self contained Eclipse project of the Olhares workshop
poster generator. It uses toxiclibs volumeutils to create a detailed
terrain translated from a grayscale bitmap image and a terrain function.
Rendering of the terrain is handled through OpenGL and an VBO.
