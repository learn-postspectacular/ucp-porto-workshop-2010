Day 5 workshop projects/exercises
========================================================================

This is a complete & self contained Eclipse project demonstrating how to
export generated artwork as image sequences and high resolution bitmaps.
We also played around with OpenGL basics and introduced Vertex Buffer
Objects to deal with millions of polygons efficiently, bypassing Processing's
render pipeline entirely. The TiledBitmapVBO demo creates a cube grid of
over 2 million triangles and renders highres images upon keypress.
